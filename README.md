# Quasistatic-FEM
This project implements quasistatic FEM solver for hyperelastic deformation modeling.
Three different hyperelastic models are included: Linear elasticity, St-Venant Kirchoff and Corotated elasticity.
Conjugate gradient method for solving linear equations is included.
The results of rest-state grid positions are written to Houdini-compatible obj files.
